# Quartz

Welcome to the my project for all of my CPU design ideas. This repository will contain all of the circuit designs, tools made during development, and (hopefully) documentation for a CPU designed using basic logic chips. This project is partially because of my studies in computer science and CPU architecture. Itâ€™s structured to evolve over three planned iterations, gradually introducing more complexity and advanced features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and potentially build a fully functional computer using only basic logic gates, keeping it as simple and understandable as possible. The design is being developed using **[Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)** for circuit simulation and design, and code for tools written in **C**, **C++**, or **Python** to handle tasks like ROM generation and code compilation.

### Project Iterations

The project is structured in three main iterations, each focusing on increasing complexity and new features:

- **Version 0**: A minimalistic, vertical slice of the project. This version will contain the core CPU functionalities, so that it can be improved in later iterations.
- **Version 1**: Builds upon Version 0, introducing additional instruction types, pipelining, and hopefully improving performance.
- **Version 2**: Building on Version 1, adding support for multiple cores, caching mechanisms, and security features such as virtual addressing and protection rings.

### Areas of Development

1. **Circuit Design**: All circuits are designed in **[Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)**, with the possibility of later implementing these designs with physical PCBs.
2. **ROM Generation**: Any of the ROM chips used in the control logic of the CPU will be generated.
3. **Code Generation and Compilation**: A custom compiler will be written for a flavour of assembly for each ISA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. CMake: Version 3.10 or higher is required to build the project.
   - You can download CMake from [cmake.org](cmake.org).
2. A C Compiler: You will need a C compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC) to build the library.
3. Logisim-evolution: This is used to design/simulate all of the circuits. This runs on Java so requires your operating system to support the JRE.
   - You can download the latest release of Logisim-evolution from [here](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases/latest).

### Installation

To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name`
2. Compilation steps to be determined but will most likely use cmake
